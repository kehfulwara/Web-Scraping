Scraping a Live Website with Beautiful Soup
Using Beautiful Soup to parse HTML and extract the pieces we are interested in. Scraping a live website is more engaging than working with local files, so we will now focus on extracting data from a live site.

Target Website: Hacker News
Use YCombinator's Hacker News website, where users post tech-related news or showcase their projects. For example, there is a website called My Desk Tour where users can share pictures of their desk setups. We will scrape the main Hacker News page, which displays the latest tech news.
